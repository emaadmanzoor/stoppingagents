# Stopping Agents

*Language agents for optimal stopping*

{: style="margin-top: 1.8rem;"}
Stopping agents are language agents --- large language models that
generate *decisions* --- specialized for optimal stopping of conversations.

Specifically, stopping agents observe the ongoing conversation text and
make sequential `wait` or `quit` decisions that optimally tradeoff between waiting
to accumulate more information and incurring waiting costs.

This project is based on the following research:

> Manzoor, Emaad, and Ascarza, Eva and Netzer, Oded. Learning When to Quit in Sales Conversations. arXiv preprint [arXiv:2511.01181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01181) (2025).
